      <p className="text-lg mb-4 text-gray-800">
        For decades, Dubai depended on fossil fuels—mostly natural gas and oil—for electricity and water. These fuels are non-renewable: they take millions of years to form, but are burned faster than they can be replaced. Burning fossil fuels releases CO₂, the main greenhouse gas driving climate change.

      <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 mb-6 ml-6 text-gray-700">
        <li>Fossil fuels pollute Dubai’s air, contribute to asthma and heat stress.</li>
        <li>Natural gas and oil supplies can run out; prices rise—families pay higher DEWA bills in summer.</li>
        <li>Physics: Only ~40% of energy is converted to electricity—the rest is lost as waste heat.</li>
        <li>Polluting plants raise Dubai’s urban temperature and risk.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="text-lg mb-5 text-gray-700">
        That’s why Dubai launched its Clean Energy Strategy 2050: to cut pollution, lower bills, and build a sustainable future with renewables.
